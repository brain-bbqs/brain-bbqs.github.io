### About
The Data Coordination and Artificial Intelligence Center (DCAIC, pronounced as *dee-cake*) will act as a data management and sharing hub for BBQS projects. DCAIC will oversee activities in five interrelated categories:

1. Data Management
2. Data Standards 
3. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) Resources
4. Data Ecosystem 
5. Dissemination, Training, and Coordination  

The BBQS research program is characterized by certain features and challenges that need to be addressed by creating a multi-component, cross-discipline team. The DCAIC is expected to support, communicate, coordinate, and collaborate with the other BBQS projects on each category of research activities.
