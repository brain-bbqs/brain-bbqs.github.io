The Ecosystem for Multi-modal Brain-behavior Experimentation and Research ([EMBER](http://emberarchive.org/)) is NIH’s data archive for brain and behavior data collected from multiple animal species, including humans. EMBER supports the BRAIN Initiative’s Brain Behavior Quantification and Synchronization (BBQS) program by enabling the storage, processing, and curation of multimodal datasets, including neural, behavioral, physiological, and environmental recordings. EMBER will accelerate discovery and foster collaboration across the BBQS consortium and the broader neuroscience community through data harmonization and synchronization capabilities, as well as metadata support and scalable queries across modalities.

To serve a wide range of data needs from initial preprocessing to publication, and from replication of published findings to novel exploration and secondary analysis, EMBER implements three specialized assets:

- EMBER-DANDI, which extends established BRAIN Initiative infrastructure to facilitate open data sharing for non-sensitive data;
- EMBERvault, a HIPAA-compliant storage for PII/PHI (including video and audio) from human participants;
- Temporary sandboxes for preliminary analysis and data ingest preparation.
